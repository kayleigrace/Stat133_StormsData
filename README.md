# Stat133_StormsData


In this project I analyzed the data set "storms." I used the packages ggplot2 and dyplar. I learned how to manipulate data through functions such as filter, select, distinct, summarise, group_by, and arrange. I learned how to visualize data using ggplot2 and practicing with bar graphs, scatter plots, and box plots.
